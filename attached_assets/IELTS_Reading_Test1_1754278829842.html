<h3>Questions 1–14</h3>
<div class="paragraph">w</div>
<div class="paragraph">hich are based on Reading Passage 1</div>
<div class="paragraph">below.</div>
<div class="paragraph">T</div>
<div class="paragraph">est 1</div>
<div class="paragraph">18</div>
<div class="paragraph">Adults and children are frequently confronted with</div>
<div class="paragraph">statements about the alarming rate of loss of tropical</div>
<div class="paragraph">rainforests. For example, one graphic illustration to</div>
<div class="paragraph">which children might readily relate is the estimate that</div>
<div class="paragraph">rainforests are being destroyed at a rate equivalent to one</div>
<div class="paragraph">thousand football fields every forty minutes – about the</div>
<div class="paragraph">duration of a normal classroom period. In the face of the</div>
<div class="paragraph">frequent and often vivid media coverage, it is likely that</div>
<div class="paragraph">children will have formed ideas about rainforests – what</div>
<div class="paragraph">and where they are, why they are important, what endan-</div>
<div class="paragraph">gers them – independent of any formal tuition. It is also</div>
<div class="paragraph">possible that some of these ideas will be mistaken.</div>
<div class="paragraph">Many studies have shown that children harbour misconceptions about ‘pure’, cur-</div>
<div class="paragraph">riculum science. These misconceptions do not remain isolated but become incorpo-</div>
<div class="paragraph">rated into a multifaceted, but organised, conceptual framework, making it and the</div>
<div class="paragraph">component ideas, some of which are erroneous, more robust but also accessible to</div>
<div class="paragraph">modification. These ideas may be developed by children absorbing ideas through the</div>
<div class="paragraph">popular media. Sometimes this information may be erroneous. It seems schools may</div>
<div class="paragraph">not be providing an opportunity for children to re-express their ideas and so have them</div>
<div class="paragraph">tested and refined by teachers and their peers.</div>
<div class="paragraph">Despite the extensive coverage in the popular media of the destruction of rainforests,</div>
<div class="paragraph">little formal information is available about children’s ideas in this area. The aim of the</div>
<div class="paragraph">present study is to start to provide such information, to help teachers design their edu-</div>
<div class="paragraph">cational strategies to build upon correct ideas and to displace misconceptions and to</div>
<div class="paragraph">plan programmes in environmental studies in their schools.</div>
<div class="paragraph">The study surveys children’s scientific knowledge and attitudes to rainforests.</div>
<div class="paragraph">Secondary school children were asked to complete a questionnaire containing five</div>
<div class="paragraph">open-form questions. The most frequent responses to the first question were descrip-</div>
<div class="paragraph">tions which are self-evident from the term ‘rainforest’. Some children described them</div>
<div class="paragraph">as damp, wet or hot. The second question concerned the geographical location of rain-</div>
<div class="paragraph">forests. The commonest responses were continents or countries: Africa (given by 43%</div>
<div class="paragraph">of children), South America (30%), Brazil (25%). Some children also gave more</div>
<div class="paragraph">general locations, such as being near the Equator.</div>
<div class="paragraph">R</div>
<div class="paragraph">eading</div>
<div class="paragraph">19</div>
<div class="paragraph">Responses to question three concerned the importance of rainforests. The domi-</div>
<div class="paragraph">nant idea, raised by 64% of the pupils, was that rainforests provide animals with habi-</div>
<div class="paragraph">t</div>
<div class="paragraph">ats. Fewer students responded that rainforests provide plant habitats, and even fewer</div>
<div class="paragraph">mentioned the indigenous populations of rainforests. More girls (70%) than boys</div>
<div class="paragraph">(60%) raised the idea of rainforest as animal habitats.</div>
<div class="paragraph">Similarly, but at a lower level, more girls (13%) than boys (5%) said that rainforests</div>
<div class="paragraph">provided human habitats. These observations are generally consistent with our previ-</div>
<div class="paragraph">ous studies of pupils’ views about the use and conservation of rainforests, in which</div>
<div class="paragraph">girls were shown to be more sympathetic to animals and expressed views which seem</div>
<div class="paragraph">to place an intrinsic value on non-human animal life.</div>
<div class="paragraph">The fourth question concerned the causes of the destruction of rainforests. Perhaps</div>
<div class="paragraph">encouragingly, more than half of the pupils (59%) identified that it is human activities</div>
<div class="paragraph">which are destroying rainforests, some personalising the responsibility by the use of</div>
<div class="paragraph">terms such as ‘we are’. About 18% of the pupils referred specifically to logging activity.</div>
<div class="paragraph">One misconception, expressed by some 10% of the pupils, was that acid rain is</div>
<div class="paragraph">responsible for rainforest destruction; a similar proportion said that pollution is</div>
<div class="paragraph">destroying rainforests. Here, children are confusing rainforest destruction with</div>
<div class="paragraph">damage to the forests of Western Europe by these factors. While two fifths of the stu-</div>
<div class="paragraph">dents provided the information that the rainforests provide oxygen, in some cases this</div>
<div class="paragraph">response also embraced the misconception that rainforest destruction would reduce</div>
<div class="paragraph">atmospheric oxygen, making the atmosphere incompatible with human life on Earth.</div>
<div class="paragraph">In answer to the final question about the importance of rainforest conservation, the</div>
<div class="paragraph">majority of children simply said that we need rainforests to survive. Only a few of the</div>
<div class="paragraph">pupils (6%) mentioned that rainforest destruction may contribute to global warming.</div>
<div class="paragraph">This is surprising considering the high level of media coverage on this issue. Some</div>
<div class="paragraph">children expressed the idea that the conservation of rainforests is not important.</div>
<div class="paragraph">The results of this study suggest that certain ideas predominate in the thinking of</div>
<div class="paragraph">children about rainforests. Pupils’ responses indicate some misconceptions in basic</div>
<div class="paragraph">scientific knowledge of rainforests’ ecosystems such as their ideas about rainforests as</div>
<div class="paragraph">habitats for animals, plants and humans and the relationship between climatic change</div>
<div class="paragraph">and destruction of rainforests.</div>
<div class="paragraph">Pupils did not volunteer ideas that suggested that they appreciated the complexity of</div>
<div class="paragraph">causes of rainforest destruction. In other words, they gave no indication of an appreci-</div>
<div class="paragraph">ation of either the range of ways in which rainforests are important or the complex</div>
<div class="paragraph">social, economic and political factors which drive the activities which are destroying</div>
<div class="paragraph">the rainforests. One encouragement is that the results of similar studies about other</div>
<div class="paragraph">environmental issues suggest that older children seem to acquire the ability to appre-</div>
<div class="paragraph">ciate, value and evaluate conflicting views. Environmental education offers an arena in</div>
<div class="paragraph">which these skills can be developed, which is essential for these children as future deci-</div>
<div class="paragraph">sion-makers.</div>

<h3>Questions 15–26</h3>
<div class="paragraph">w</div>
<div class="paragraph">hich are based on Reading Passage 2</div>
<div class="paragraph">below.</div>

<div class="paragraph">An examination of the functioning of the senses in cetaceans, the</div>
<div class="paragraph">group of mammals comprising whales, dolphins and porpoises</div>
<div class="paragraph">Some of the senses that we and other ter restrial mammals take for granted are either</div>
<div class="paragraph">r</div>
<div class="paragraph">educed or absent in cetaceans or fail to function well in water. For example, it appears</div>
<div class="paragraph">from their brain structure that toothed species are unable to smell. Baleen species,</div>
<div class="paragraph">on the other hand, appear to have some related brain structures but it is not known</div>
<div class="paragraph">whether these are functional. It has been speculated that, as the blowholes evolved</div>
<div class="paragraph">and migrated to the top of the head, the neural pathways serving sense of smell may</div>
<div class="paragraph">have been nearly all sacriﬁced. Similarly, although at least some cetaceans have taste</div>
<div class="paragraph">buds, the nerves serving these have degenerated or are rudimentary.</div>
<div class="paragraph">The sense of touch has sometimes been described as weak too, but this view is prob-</div>
<div class="paragraph">ably mistaken. Trainers of captive dolphins and small whales often r emark on their</div>
<div class="paragraph">animals’ responsiveness to being touched or rubbed, and both captive and free-</div>
<div class="paragraph">ranging cetacean individuals of all species (particularly adults and calves, or members</div>
<div class="paragraph">of the same subgroup) appear to make frequent contact. This contact may help to</div>
<div class="paragraph">maintain order within a group, and stroking or touching are part of the courtship ritual</div>
<div class="paragraph">in most species. The area around the blowhole is also particularly sensitive and</div>
<div class="paragraph">captive animals often object strongly to being touched there.</div>
<div class="paragraph">T</div>
<div class="paragraph">est 1</div>
<div class="paragraph">24</div>
<div class="paragraph">The sense of vision is developed to dif ferent degrees in dif ferent species. Baleen</div>
<div class="paragraph">species studied at close quarters underwater – speciﬁcally a grey whale calf in cap-</div>
<div class="paragraph">tivity for a year, and free-ranging right whales and humpback whales studied and ﬁlmed</div>
<div class="paragraph">of f Argentina and Hawaii – have obviously tracked objects with vision underwater, and</div>
<div class="paragraph">they can apparently see moderately well both in water and in air. However, the posi-</div>
<div class="paragraph">tion of the eyes so restricts the ﬁeld of vision in baleen whales that they probably do</div>
<div class="paragraph">not have stereoscopic vision.</div>
<div class="paragraph">On the other hand, the position of the eyes in most dolphins and porpoises suggests</div>
<div class="paragraph">that they have stereoscopic vision forward and downward. Eye position in freshwater</div>
<div class="paragraph">dolphins, which often swim on their side or upside down while feeding, suggests that</div>
<div class="paragraph">what vision they have is stereoscopic forward and upward. By comparison, the bot-</div>
<div class="paragraph">tlenose dolphin has extremely keen vision in water. Judging from the way it watches</div>
<div class="paragraph">and tracks airbor ne ﬂying ﬁsh, it can apparently see fairly well through the air–water</div>
<div class="paragraph">interface as well. And although preliminary experimental evidence suggests that their</div>
<div class="paragraph">in-air vision is poor, the accuracy with which dolphins leap high to take small ﬁsh out</div>
<div class="paragraph">of a trainer’s hand provides anecdotal evidence to the contrary.</div>
<div class="paragraph">Such variation can no doubt be explained with reference to the habitats in which indi-</div>
<div class="paragraph">vidual species have developed. For example, vision is obviously more useful to species</div>
<div class="paragraph">inhabiting clear open waters than to those living in turbid rivers and ﬂooded plains. The</div>
<div class="paragraph">South American boutu and Chinese beiji, for instance, appear to have very limited</div>
<div class="paragraph">vision, and the Indian susus are blind, their eyes reduced to slits that probably allow</div>
<div class="paragraph">them to sense only the direction and intensity of light.</div>
<div class="paragraph">Although the senses of taste and smell appear to have deteriorated, and vision in</div>
<div class="paragraph">water appears to be uncertain, such weaknesses are more than compensated for by</div>
<div class="paragraph">cetaceans’ well-developed acoustic sense. Most species are highly vocal, although</div>
<div class="paragraph">they vary in the range of sounds they produce, and many forage for food using echolo-</div>
<div class="paragraph">cation</div>
<div class="paragraph">1</div>
<div class="paragraph">. Large baleen whales primarily use the lower frequencies and are often limited</div>
<div class="paragraph">in their repertoire. Notable exceptions are the nearly song-like choruses of bowhead</div>
<div class="paragraph">whales in summer and the complex, haunting utterances of the humpback whales.</div>
<div class="paragraph">T</div>
<div class="paragraph">oothed species in general employ more of the frequency spectrum, and produce a</div>
<div class="paragraph">wider variety of sounds, than baleen species (though the sper m whale apparently pro-</div>
<div class="paragraph">duces a monotonous series of high-energy clicks and little else). Some of the more</div>
<div class="paragraph">complicated sounds are clearly communicative, although what role they may play in</div>
<div class="paragraph">the social life and ‘culture’ of cetaceans has been more the subject of wild specula-</div>
<div class="paragraph">tion than of solid science.</div>

<div class="paragraph">This fact was drawn to my attention dramatically when a blind</div>
<div class="paragraph">woman in one of my investigations decided on her own initiative to</div>
<div class="paragraph">draw a wheel as it was spinning. To show this motion, she traced a</div>
<div class="paragraph">curve inside the circle (</div>
<div class="paragraph">Fig. 1</div>
<div class="paragraph">). I was taken aback. Lines of motion,</div>
<div class="paragraph">such as the one she used, are a very recent invention in the history</div>
<div class="paragraph">of illustration. Indeed, as art scholar David Kunzle notes, Wilhelm</div>
<div class="paragraph">Busch, a trend-setting nineteenth-century cartoonist, used virtually</div>
<div class="paragraph">no motion lines in his popular ﬁgures until about 1877.</div>
<div class="paragraph">When I asked several other blind study subjects to draw a spinning wheel, one partic-</div>
<div class="paragraph">ularly clever rendition appeared repeatedly: several subjects showed the wheel’s</div>
<div class="paragraph">spokes as curved lines. When asked about these curves, they all described them as</div>
<div class="paragraph">metaphorical ways of suggesting motion. Majority rule would argue that this device</div>
<div class="paragraph">somehow indicated motion very well. But was it a better indicator than, say, broken</div>
<div class="paragraph">or wavy lines – or any other kind of line, for that matter? The answer was not clear. So</div>
<div class="paragraph">I decided to test whether various lines of motion were apt ways of showing movement</div>
<div class="paragraph">or if they were merely idiosyncratic marks. Moreover, I wanted to discover whether</div>
<div class="paragraph">there were differences in how the blind and the sighted interpreted lines of motion.</div>
<div class="paragraph">To</div>
<div class="paragraph">search out these answers, I created raised-line drawings of ﬁve different wheels,</div>
<div class="paragraph">depicting spokes with lines that curved, bent, waved, dashed and extended beyond</div>
<div class="paragraph">the perimeter of the wheel. I then asked eighteen blind volunteers to feel the wheels</div>
<div class="paragraph">and assign one of the following motions to each wheel: wobbling, spinning fast, spin-</div>
<div class="paragraph">ning steadily, jerking or braking. My control group consisted of eighteen sighted</div>
<div class="paragraph">undergraduates from the University of Toronto.</div>
<div class="paragraph">All but one of the blind subjects assigned distinctive motions to each wheel. Most</div>
<div class="paragraph">guessed that the curved spokes indicated that the wheel was spinning steadily; the</div>
<div class="paragraph">wavy spokes, they thought, suggested that the wheel was wobbling; and the bent</div>
<div class="paragraph">spokes were taken as a sign that the wheel was jerking. Subjects assumed that spokes</div>
<div class="paragraph">extending beyond the wheel’s perimeter signiﬁed that the wheel had its brakes on and</div>
<div class="paragraph">that dashed spokes indicated the wheel was spinning quickly.</div>
<div class="paragraph">Fig. 1</div>
<div class="paragraph">T</div>
<div class="paragraph">est 1</div>
<div class="paragraph">28</div>
<div class="paragraph">In addition, the favoured description for the sighted was the favoured description for</div>
<div class="paragraph">the blind in every instance. What is more, the consensus among the sighted was barely</div>
<div class="paragraph">higher than that among the blind. Because motion devices are unfamiliar to the blind,</div>
<div class="paragraph">the task I gave them involved some problem solving. Evidently, however, the blind not</div>
<div class="paragraph">only ﬁgured out meanings for each line of motion, but as a group they generally came</div>
<div class="paragraph">up with the same meaning at least as frequently as did sighted subjects.</div>
<div class="paragraph">Part 2</div>
<div class="paragraph">We</div>
<div class="paragraph">have found that the blind understand other kinds of visual metaphors as well. One</div>
<div class="paragraph">blind woman drew a picture of a child inside a heart – choosing that symbol, she said,</div>
<div class="paragraph">to show that love surrounded the child. With Chang Hong Liu, a doctoral student from</div>
<div class="paragraph">China, I have begun exploring how well blind people understand the symbolism</div>
<div class="paragraph">behind shapes such as hearts that do not directly represent their meaning.</div>
<div class="paragraph">We</div>
<div class="paragraph">gave a list of twenty pairs of words to</div>
<div class="paragraph">sighted subjects and asked them to pick from</div>
<div class="paragraph">each pair the term that best related to a circle</div>
<div class="paragraph">and the term that best related to a square. For</div>
<div class="paragraph">example, we asked: What goes with soft? A</div>
<div class="paragraph">circle or a square? Which shape goes with</div>
<div class="paragraph">hard?</div>
<div class="paragraph">All our subjects deemed the circle soft and the</div>
<div class="paragraph">square hard. A full 94% ascribed happy to the</div>
<div class="paragraph">circle, instead of sad. But other pairs revealed</div>
<div class="paragraph">less agreement: 79% matched fast to slow and</div>
<div class="paragraph">weak to strong, respectively. And only 51%</div>
<div class="paragraph">linked deep to circle and shallow to square.</div>
<div class="paragraph">(See</div>
<div class="paragraph">Fig. 2.</div>
<div class="paragraph">) When we tested four totally blind</div>
<div class="paragraph">volunteers using the same list, we found that</div>
<div class="paragraph">their choices closely resembled those made by</div>
<div class="paragraph">the sighted subjects. One man, who had been</div>
<div class="paragraph">blind since birth, scored extremely well. He</div>
<div class="paragraph">made only one match differing from the con-</div>
<div class="paragraph">sensus, assigning ‘far’ to square and ‘near’ to</div>
<div class="paragraph">circle. In fact, only a small majority of sighted</div>
<div class="paragraph">subjects – 53% – had paired far and near to the</div>
<div class="paragraph">opposite partners. Thus, we concluded that the</div>
<div class="paragraph">blind interpret abstract shapes as sighted</div>
<div class="paragraph">people do.</div>
