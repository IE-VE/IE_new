    <!-- Band 1 -->
    <band number="1">
        <fluencyAndCoherence>
            Essentially none. Speech is totally incoherent.
        </fluencyAndCoherence>
        <lexicalResource>
            No resource bar a few isolated words. No communication possible.
        </lexicalResource>
        <grammaticalRangeAndAccuracy>
            No notable language unless memorised.
        </grammaticalRangeAndAccuracy>
        <pronunciation>
            Can produce occasional individual words and phonemes that are largely not comprehensible.
            Unintelligible.
        </pronunciation>
    </band>

    <!-- Band 2 -->
    <band number="2">
        <fluencyAndCoherence>
            Lengthy pauses before nearly every word.
            Isolated words may be recognisable but speech is virtually no communicative content.
        </fluencyAndCoherence>
        <lexicalResource>
            Very limited resource. Utterances consist of isolated words or memorised utterances.
            Little communication possible without the support of mime or gesture.
        </lexicalResource>
        <grammaticalRangeAndAccuracy>
            No evidence of basic sentence forms.
        </grammaticalRangeAndAccuracy>
        <pronunciation>
            Uses few acceptable phonological features (possibly because sample is insufficient).
            Overall problems with delivery impair attempts at connected speech.
            Individual words and phonemes are mainly mispronounced and little meaning is conveyed.
        </pronunciation>
    </band>

    <!-- Band 3 -->
    <band number="3">
        <fluencyAndCoherence>

            Possibly frequently unable to convey basic meaning.
        </fluencyAndCoherence>
        <lexicalResource>
            Resource limited to simple vocabulary used primarily to convey personal information.
            Vocabulary inadequate for unfamiliar topics.
        </lexicalResource>
        <grammaticalRangeAndAccuracy>
            Basic sentence forms are attempted but grammatical errors are numerous
            except in apparently memorised utterances.
        </grammaticalRangeAndAccuracy>
        <pronunciation>
            Displays some features of band 2, and some, but not all,
            of the positive features of band 4.
        </pronunciation>
    </band>

    <!-- Band 4 -->
    <band number="4">
        <fluencyAndCoherence>
            Unable to keep going for long without noticeable pauses.
            Speech may be slow with frequent repetition and self-correction.
            Rarely attempts to link ideas or use them in a coherent manner.
        </fluencyAndCoherence>
        <lexicalResource>
            Resource sufficient for familiar topics but extremely limited for unfamiliar topics.
            Rarely attempts paraphrase.
        </lexicalResource>
        <grammaticalRangeAndAccuracy>
            Can produce basic sentence forms with some accuracy, but errors are frequent and serious
            even in simple structures. More complex forms are rare.
        </grammaticalRangeAndAccuracy>
        <pronunciation>
            Uses some acceptable phonological features but fails to control these consistently.
            Frequent mispronunciation of words or sounds.
            Intonation is mostly absent and cannot be understood sometimes,
            resulting in the listener needing extra effort to interpret meaning.
        </pronunciation>
    </band>

    <!-- Band 5 -->
    <band number="5">
        <fluencyAndCoherence>

        </fluencyAndCoherence>
        <lexicalResource>
            Resource sufficient to discuss familiar and unfamiliar topics but there is limited flexibility.

    <!-- Band 6 -->
    <band number="6">
        <fluencyAndCoherence>
            Able to keep going and demonstrate a willingness to produce long turns.
            Coherence may be lost at times as a result of hesitation, repetition and/or self-correction.
        </fluencyAndCoherence>
        <lexicalResource>
            Resource sufficient to discuss topics in a general way.
            Vocabulary use may be inappropriate but meaning is clear.
        </lexicalResource>
        <grammaticalRangeAndAccuracy>
            Produces a mix of short and complex sentence forms and a variety of structures with some accuracy.
            Though errors frequently occur in complex structures, they rarely impede communication.
        </grammaticalRangeAndAccuracy>
        <pronunciation>
            Uses a range of phonological features, but control is variable and may limit clarity at times.
            Generally understood, but occasional mispronunciation or intonation problems may cause
            breakdowns in clarity. Overall meaning can be conveyed without much effort.
        </pronunciation>

    <!-- Band 7 -->
    <band number="7">
        <fluencyAndCoherence>
            Able to keep going and readily produce long stretches of language without noticeable effort.
            Some hesitation, repetition and/or self-correction, but these do not interfere with meaning.
            Ideas are clear, with mid-sentence and discourse-level connectors to develop main and supporting points.
            They may be inaccurate at times, but they do not prevent coherence.

            Resource flexibly used to discuss a variety of topics.
            Some less common or idiomatic vocabulary used.

        <fluencyAndCoherence>
            Fluent with only very occasional repetition or self-correction.
            Hesitation may occasionally be used to find words or grammar,

        <fluencyAndCoherence>
            Speaks fluently with only rare repetition or self-correction.
