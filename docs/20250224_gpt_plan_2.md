Below is a **strict, time-bound schedule** with **clear goals, milestones, and “stop/continue” consequences** so you can protect yourselves from pouring indefinite resources into a non-viable product. This plan is deliberately **structured and somewhat rigid**—the goal is to prevent endless drift if conversions don’t materialize.

---

# 1. Overview of the “Stop/Continue” Framework

- You will follow **4 time blocks** (some 2-week, some 1-month).
- Each block has **specific measurable targets**.
- If you **hit** or **exceed** the targets, move to the next block.
- If you **fail** to meet targets, you either:
  1. **Pivot** (adjust your product/offer drastically), or
  2. **Stop** altogether (shut down or put the project on ice).

The key is to define **in advance** the numerical thresholds that trigger pivot or shutdown. This ensures you stay rational even if you feel emotionally attached.

# 2. Detailed Schedule with Goals & Consequences

## BLOCK A (Weeks 1–2)

### Goals

1. **Technical Finalization**

   - Finish AI band score calibration: do the “few-shot” approach or a consistent “+1 band if in doubt.”
   - Enforce the 25–30 second minimum on recordings.
   - ✔ Finalize the \$15 “5-day plan” upsell content (the basic daily tasks).

2. **Ads & Tracking Setup**

   - Integrate basic Google/Facebook Ads with a daily spend cap (e.g., \$10–\$20/day).
   - ✔ Implement analytics to measure (a) free test completions, (b) how many see results, (c) how many click the upsell, and (d) how many actually pay.

3. **Test the Funnel with Minimal Traffic**
   - For the next 2 weeks, you aim to get **at least 100 free test completions** from your small ad spend or any existing channels.
   - **Collect** 2–4 paying users (that’s a 2–4% conversion) or more.

### Consequences

- **If fewer than 100 test completions** happen in 2 weeks, you might not have enough data to judge. You can choose to extend by 1 more week **only once**. But be aware, it may signal that your marketing or ad approach is too weak.
- **If you get 100+ completions but 0–1 paid** conversions (\<1% conversion), you either:
  1. **Pivot** your paid offer drastically (e.g., reduce it to \$5 or offer a different solution), or
  2. **Stop** if you feel you’ve tried everything feasible in this short upsell model.
- **If you get at least 2–4 paying** (i.e., \>2% conversion) or you see promising user feedback (some open to paying more), **proceed to Block B**.

> **Deadline**: **Day 14** from “start.” By the end of these 2 weeks, decide: continue or pivot/stop.

---

## BLOCK B (Weeks 3–4)

### Goals

1. **Refine & Stabilize**

   - Tweak your calibration if data from Block A shows it’s still 1 band off.
   - If you pivoted to a \$5 plan or changed the upsell, finalize that version quickly.
   - Possibly add a small “live chat” or “WhatsApp link” on the results page for user questions.

2. **Ad Spend Increase (Small)**

   - If Block A had a workable cost per lead (CPL) and a decent conversion, increase daily spend from \$10–\$20/day to maybe \$20–\$30/day.
   - Aim for **at least 200 new free tests** total in these 2 weeks.

3. **Conversion Check**
   - You want **at least 4–8** paying users out of 200 (2–4% conversion again), but **aim higher** if you suspect better traction.

### Consequences

- **If cost per lead (CPL) is too high** (like \$5–\$8/lead) and your conversion is 1% or less, you’re losing money. That’s a red flag.
- **If, by end of Week 4, you’re still under 2%** conversions, you can:
  - Attempt one last pivot (change the product structure, shorten the free test, etc.)
  - **Or** stop to avoid draining resources further.
- **If you have 2–4% or better** conversions at a manageable ad cost, **proceed** to Block C.

> **Deadline**: **Day 28** from start. Decide if ROI is good enough to keep going.

---

## BLOCK C (Month 2–3)

_(We now switch to a 2-month window, giving you a bit more room to scale and gather data.)_

### Goals

1. **Scale & Measure Real ROI**

   - Raise ad spend further, e.g., up to \$30–\$50/day if ROI looks positive.
   - Aim for ~1,000–2,000 free test completions over the next 2 months to see if the funnel truly works at scale.

2. **Break-Even or Slight Profit**

   - By the end of Month 3, you ideally want your monthly revenue from upsells to at least **match** your monthly ad spend **plus** AI usage costs.
   - Example:
     - If you spend \$1,000 total on ads over ~8 weeks, plus \$300 in AI bills, your total cost is \$1,300.
     - If you convert 2.5% out of 1,000 testers → 25 paying users \* \$15 = \$375. That’s not enough to break even (\$375 vs. \$1,300).
     - So you’d be net -\$925. That’s a fail scenario.

3. **User Retention or Upgrade**
   - Optionally introduce a second product or a “next step” for those who finish the 5-day plan. If you see they want more intense coaching or a bigger plan, you can test a \$49 or \$99 tier.
   - If your original \$15 plan fails, you might pivot to \$5 or to a more robust \$29 plan with real “live calls.”

### Consequences

- **If by the end of Month 3** you cannot break even or at least see a path to break-even soon (i.e., conversions keep you at >\$500 net losses monthly), you risk indefinite bleed.
- If you see momentum (maybe you’re at a smaller net loss but conversions are rising weekly), you can keep going for another month or two.
- If you’re still nowhere near revenue that offsets costs, strongly consider **stopping** to protect finances and time.

> **Deadline**: End of Month 3 (around Day ~90). Either see a stable funnel that’s near break-even or choose to pivot drastically/stop.

---

## BLOCK D (Months 4–6)

### Goals

1. **Optimized or Expanding**

   - If you survived Block C with break-even or small profit, you can scale up further or add advanced features like:
     - 3-minute calls
     - Advanced Pronunciation Drills
     - Higher-tier coaching
   - You’re only adding these if you have a stable, proven funnel for the \$15 plan or your pivoted product.

2. **Begin Partnerships**

   - Possibly approach local IELTS tutors or small edtech micro-influencers for affiliate deals. But only if you have data that your funnel converts well.

3. **Profit or Hard Stop**
   - By Month 6, the venture should **consistently** pay for the monthly AI/ads with some leftover or at least a clear trajectory to monthly profit.
   - If it still does not, you face the tough decision: keep throwing money/time or accept the market isn’t responding.

### Consequences

- **Success**: You see stable or growing revenue, net positive or break-even. Then you scale or talk to investors if that’s your path.
- **Failure**: If you’re still negative by a large margin, you likely **stop** or “sunset” the product. Your developer can move on, and you remain an IELTS examiner without a big sunk cost.

> **Deadline**: ~Month 6. This is your final major checkpoint.

# 3. “Stop or Continue” Thresholds (Summary)

Below are your **crucial numeric thresholds** in brief:

1. **Block A (Weeks 1–2)**:

   - **At least** 100 test completions
   - **At least** 2 paying (\>2% conversion)
   - If <2 paying, pivot or stop.

2. **Block B (Weeks 3–4)**:

   - **Another** 200 completions
   - Aim for **4–8** paying (\~2–4%).
   - If <2% again, pivot or stop.

3. **Block C (Months 2–3)**:

   - Increase scale to 1,000+ total completions
   - Need near break-even on AI + ad spend.
   - If big net loss, pivot or stop.

4. **Block D (Months 4–6)**:
   - Aim for consistent net positive or near break-even each month.
   - If still big losses or no improvement, **stop**.

You can adjust these numbers slightly, but the point is to **lock them in** as your guardrails.

---

# 4. Additional Protections

1. **Budget Caps**
   - If you see no success in the first 2 blocks, **cap your total ad spend** at, say, \$500–\$1,000. Don’t keep throwing money.
2. **Time-Boxed Development**
   - Developer’s time is also a cost. If you fail to meet Block B goals, **no new features** get built. Focus only on “fix or close.”
3. **Minimum Price**
   - Don’t go below \$5 for a paid product unless you’re certain you can handle a huge volume. Very low price can kill your margins even if you get conversions.

---

# 5. Example Gantt-Style Timeline

```
Week 1–2 (Block A)
|--- Finalize calibration
|--- Launch minimal ads (cap $10/day)
|--- Minimum 2 paying out of 100 testers -> else pivot/stop
| (Decision Gate)

Week 3–4 (Block B)
|--- If continuing, refine funnel, maybe double ad spend
|--- Aim 200 testers, 4–8 paying
| (Decision Gate)

Months 2–3 (Block C)
|--- Scale ads if ROI ok
|--- Need break-even or near break-even
|--- Possibly add a second product or pivot if fail
| (Decision Gate at Month 3)

Months 4–6 (Block D)
|--- Attempt bigger scale or advanced features
|--- Must be net positive or see major improvement
| (Stop if still big losses)
```

---

## Final Takeaway

This schedule is intentionally **strict**:

- You have 2-week blocks initially to gather quick real-world data on small ad spends.
- Each “block” ends in a **decision**: continue, pivot, or shut down.
- You only progress to the next block if you’ve **met** or **exceeded** the threshold.

By using clear numerical conversion goals and expense caps, you **protect** your finances and time from indefinite drift. If the market or funnel fails to respond within these constraints, you’ll step away with minimal regret—because you gave it a fair, bounded shot.
