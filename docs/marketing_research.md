Got it! I’ll research where IELTS test-takers and English learners are most active online, including social media groups, forums, and discussion platforms. I'll also identify strategies for organically sharing your landing page in these communities to generate engagement and feedback quickly.

I’ll get back to you with insights soon.

# Key Online Communities for IELTS Test-Takers

IELTS candidates and English learners congregate on various online platforms to exchange preparation tips, seek feedback, and share resources. Below are some of the most active communities across social media groups, forums, and discussion platforms, along with examples of specific groups or channels. Communities that **encourage sharing free resources or self-promotion** are highlighted:

## Facebook Groups

Facebook hosts numerous IELTS-focused groups, many with tens or hundreds of thousands of members. These groups are popular for Q&A, resource sharing, and finding study partners. _Tip:_ Look for public groups with high member counts and frequent posts – they tend to be more permissive about sharing links. Some notable examples include:

- **IELTS Free Preparation 9.0** – A public group with around **367,000 members** (one of the largest IELTS groups on Facebook) ([List of IELTS Facebook Groups - Travel with Karla](https://travelwithkarla.com/2022/01/24/list-of-ielts-facebook-groups/#:~:text=IELTS%20Free%20Preparation%209)). Members actively share tips, materials, and ask questions. Moderation is light, meaning you’ll see a lot of posts (and unfortunately some spam) ([The Best Facebook Groups for IELTS - TED IELTS](https://ted-ielts.com/the-best-facebook-groups-for-ielts/#:~:text=One%20of%20the%20biggest%20IELTS,group%2C%20but%20proceed%20with%20caution)). The upside is that _legitimate free resources_ can be shared here without strict approval – just ensure your post offers value to stand out from the noise.
- **IELTS Tips & Tricks** – Another large group run by an IELTS instructor (Rafael Salguero). It’s known for strict rules and active moderation ([The Best Facebook Groups for IELTS - TED IELTS](https://ted-ielts.com/the-best-facebook-groups-for-ielts/#:~:text=IELTS%20Tips%20%26%20Tricks%20is,environment%20than%20the%20group%20above)). The community is orderly and spam-free, but you should **follow the group rules** closely. Self-promotion is possible only if it genuinely helps members and likely with admin permission.
- **IELTS MOOC Study Group** – A massive open group (over a quarter million members as of a few years ago) ([The Best Facebook Groups for IELTS - TED IELTS](https://ted-ielts.com/the-best-facebook-groups-for-ielts/#:~:text=The%20IELTS%20MOOC%20Study%20Group,source%20of%20advice%20on%20writing)) originally formed around a free IELTS MOOC. Members frequently post their essays or questions to get free feedback. Engagement is high, but posts can get buried due to volume. Sharing a free resource _in context_ (for example, as a comment on someone asking for materials) could get attention here.
- **IELTS Resources** – A group dedicated to exchanging IELTS study materials ([The Best Facebook Groups for IELTS - TED IELTS](https://ted-ielts.com/the-best-facebook-groups-for-ielts/#:~:text=advice%20on%20writing)). Members swap practice tests, ebooks, and other resources (often unofficial copies). This means they’re very receptive to **free prep materials**. Posting your landing page link (since it’s a free resource) fits the group’s purpose – just avoid anything that looks like selling.
- **English Speaking Practice Group** – A huge public group (~206,000 members) aimed at general English speaking practice, not solely IELTS ([List of IELTS Facebook Groups - Travel with Karla](https://travelwithkarla.com/2022/01/24/list-of-ielts-facebook-groups/#:~:text=English%20Speaking%20Practice%20Group)). Many IELTS test-takers join to find speaking partners. You can share resources here, especially if framed as helping with speaking skills. Engagement is global and high. Because it’s broad, make it clear your resource is IELTS-related to attract the right people.
- **IELTS Speaking Partners** – A private group (~110,000 members) focused on finding speaking partners ([List of IELTS Facebook Groups - Travel with Karla](https://travelwithkarla.com/2022/01/24/list-of-ielts-facebook-groups/#:~:text=IELTS%20Speaking%20Partners)). It’s moderated (by the TED-IELTS blog author) to keep posts on-topic and spam-free. Direct promotions are limited, but you can **organically network** here by offering help (e.g. ask if anyone wants to try your speaking-feedback tool). Once you’ve interacted a bit, sharing a free resource for speaking practice would be appropriate.
- **Regional IELTS Groups** – There are also country-specific groups like _IELTS Philippines Review and Training Tips_ (~19k members) for localized discussions ([List of IELTS Facebook Groups - Travel with Karla](https://travelwithkarla.com/2022/01/24/list-of-ielts-facebook-groups/#:~:text=IELTS%20Philippines%20Review%20and%20Training,Tips)). These can be highly engaged and might allow sharing relevant resources (especially if you tailor the post to the regional context). If your landing page caters to a specific region or has testimonials from local users, these groups are worth exploring.

**Why Facebook?** Facebook groups combine large audiences with a community vibe. Many IELTS candidates actively seek study buddies or materials in these groups, so a well-timed, helpful post with your landing page link can generate interest. **Prioritize** groups that have active discussions (comments and replies) rather than just one-way posts. In active groups, people are actually reading and responding to content – meaning they’re more likely to notice and engage with your link. Avoid or de-emphasize groups that are pure link dumps with little interaction (even if they have huge numbers), as those have “gone to sh\*t” in terms of user engagement ([How to Get Traffic from Facebook Groups (without Being Spammy) | VYPER - Giveaway & Contest Builder](https://vyper.ai/blog/traffic-facebook-groups/#:~:text=Step%201%3A%20Find%20the%20Group,and%20Make%20Sure%20it%E2%80%99s%20Active)).

## Reddit Communities

**Reddit** has a strong community of IELTS and English learners. The main subreddit to know is **r/IELTS**, but there are several others that IELTS test-takers use for specific needs (speaking feedback, essay reviews, etc.). Reddit tends to have knowledgeable users and ongoing Q&As. Important to note: Reddit communities often dislike blatant advertising, so plan to share organically (we cover strategies for this below). Key subreddits include:

- **r/IELTS** – The primary subreddit for IELTS discussions (with roughly **60k+ members**) ([150 English Grammar Pages: Facebook, YouTube, Reddit, Telegram | Academic Writing University Center](https://awuc.misis.ru/150-english-grammar-pages-facebook-youtube-reddit-telegram/#:~:text=102)). Users ask for advice, share experiences, and post questions about all exam sections. It’s a great place to find serious test-takers. However, **self-promotion is typically not allowed** in r/IELTS ([My new IELTS guide is now online! - Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/IELTS/comments/1hj33ia/my_new_ielts_guide_is_now_online/#:~:text=My%20new%20IELTS%20guide%20is,78)). Moderators and regulars will remove or downvote posts that look like ads. To leverage this subreddit, you should become an active contributor: answer questions, share genuine advice, and when you share your landing page, do it as a helpful resource (for example, “I created a free tool to analyze IELTS Writing – would love your feedback on it” rather than a salesy pitch). The community is receptive to free, useful tools especially if you’re transparent and not just spamming.
- **r/JudgeMyAccent** – A subreddit where English learners post voice clips to get feedback on pronunciation and accent ([150 English Grammar Pages: Facebook, YouTube, Reddit, Telegram | Academic Writing University Center](https://awuc.misis.ru/150-english-grammar-pages-facebook-youtube-reddit-telegram/#:~:text=101)). Many IELTS takers use it to improve their Speaking score. It’s not IELTS-specific, but highly relevant for speaking practice. You can engage here by giving feedback to others and mentioning your resource if it helps with pronunciation or speaking. For instance, if your landing page has a speaking evaluation feature or tips, you could say “I found this tool that helps practice speaking – tried it and it’s free” in a comment. This community values constructive feedback and useful tips.
- **r/Proofreading** – This forum allows users to submit writing for correction suggestions ([150 English Grammar Pages: Facebook, YouTube, Reddit, Telegram | Academic Writing University Center](https://awuc.misis.ru/150-english-grammar-pages-facebook-youtube-reddit-telegram/#:~:text=104)). IELTS students often want their essays reviewed, which fits r/Proofreading’s purpose (as long as it’s not an actual exam submission or class assignment). You might offer to proofread a user’s IELTS essay and mention your landing page’s writing resources or invite them to try it for more feedback. Since r/Proofreading has strict rules, be upfront that you’re sharing a free IELTS-writing resource (to avoid looking like you’re charging or cheating). If done tactfully, you can attract test-takers looking to improve Writing.
- **r/EnglishLearning** and **r/Languagelearning** – Broad subreddits for anyone learning English or languages. They have large audiences (hundreds of thousands of members) and often field questions about exams like IELTS. While not focused on IELTS, you can find relevant threads (e.g. “How to prepare for IELTS in 3 months?”) where dropping a link to a free resource is welcome. The key is to ensure your recommendation doesn’t come off as the only reason you’re there. Share it as part of a helpful answer. These broad communities can amplify your reach beyond the IELTS niche, catching people who might not yet be in IELTS-specific groups.
- **r/EnglishTutoring** – A community that connects learners and tutors, where people share study materials and advice ([150 English Grammar Pages: Facebook, YouTube, Reddit, Telegram | Academic Writing University Center](https://awuc.misis.ru/150-english-grammar-pages-facebook-youtube-reddit-telegram/#:~:text=105)). IELTS learners sometimes ask for study tips here. It’s a potential place to share your landing page if you frame it as _study material_. For example, “Here’s a free IELTS study planner I put together – hope it helps!” would align with the sub’s educational spirit.

**Why Reddit?** Reddit’s advantage is **high engagement and niche sub-communities**. A well-crafted Reddit post can spark dozens of comments and drive traffic. People there appreciate honesty and expertise. If you introduce your landing page the right way (e.g. share results, ask for suggestions, contribute real value), you can get strong feedback quickly. Just remember to read each subreddit’s rules first – many have rules on self-promotion or require a minimum karma/age to post. Breaking those will get your post removed swiftly.

## IELTS Forums and Websites

Outside of mainstream social media, there are dedicated **IELTS forums** and online communities built specifically for test preparation. These may not have the massive user counts of Facebook or Reddit, but the audience quality is high – participants are **actively seeking feedback and resources**. Such forums often allow links to useful resources as long as you’re not blatantly advertising a paid product. Key forums include:

- **IELTSNetwork.com Forum** – A long-running forum (tagline: “Public forums for the international IELTS community!”). It has sections for each test section and general discussion. Users often post their exam experiences, questions, or seek advice. For example, members share their Writing scores and ask for tips to improve, sometimes even posting essays for comment ([New Member - IELTSNetwork.com](https://ieltsnetwork.com/viewtopic.php?t=688#:~:text=Hi%20friends%2C)) ([New Member - IELTSNetwork.com](https://ieltsnetwork.com/viewtopic.php?t=688#:~:text=Hi%20Sweta%2C)). You can engage by replying with helpful insights. **Sharing your landing page** here could be done in a context like: “I’ve compiled some free practice resources on this page – it might help you,” especially if someone asks for study materials. Being an older style forum, it might require you to create an account and build a reputation over a few posts. But the upside is threads remain visible for a long time (good for steady traffic and SEO if your link stays).
- **IELTS Buddy’s Forum/Essay Feedback** – IELTSBuddy.com (a popular IELTS prep site) has interactive sections such as an _Essay Feedback Forum_ where learners submit essays and get corrections from others ([IELTS Essay Feedback Forum - IELTS buddy](https://www.ieltsbuddy.com/ielts-essay-feedback-forum.html#:~:text=IELTS%20Essay%20Feedback%20Forum%20,feedback%20from%20other%20IELTS%20candidates)). This is a highly relevant place to find IELTS writers looking for help. If you provide a thoughtful critique on someone’s essay and mention that your landing page offers a free writing correction tool or a list of sample essays, it would be seen as helpful. The forum is moderated by the site owners, but they generally welcome resource sharing as long as it’s useful and not blatant advertising (and since your page is free, it’s likely fine).
- **MyEnglishClub – IELTS Group (e.g. IELTS Skypers)** – MyEnglishClub is an English learning social network that hosts groups and discussion threads. One such group, “IELTS Skypers,” has about 700 members focusing on finding Skype/online speaking partners ([IELTS Skypers - MyEnglishClub](https://www.myenglishclub.com/xn/detail/7308224:CommentWall:283768?commentId=7308224%3AComment%3A1072291#:~:text=IELTS%20Skypers%20,Welcome%20to%20our%20group)). While smaller, these members are highly motivated (they actively seek speaking practice). Joining a niche community like this lets you directly reach real test-takers. You could introduce your landing page by starting a discussion like “What free tools do you use for IELTS prep? I’ve made one, would love for you to try.” Given the smaller size, you might get fewer absolute clicks, but the feedback could be very detailed and useful for refining your page.
- **Other Niche Forums/QA sites** – Consider Q&A platforms like **Quora** (there are topics for IELTS Preparation with many followers). On Quora, people ask IELTS questions daily (e.g. “How can I improve IELTS Listening?”). Writing a helpful answer and linking your landing page (if it directly answers the question with a free resource) can drive interested users to you. Similarly, look for **Telegram** group chats or even **WhatsApp** communities (often informal, formed by coaching classes or students) – though those are harder to find publicly, if you’re invited or come across them, they can be great for personal feedback and sharing.

## Discord Servers

**Discord** is increasingly used for study groups and real-time practice, especially among younger test-takers. Several Discord servers are dedicated to IELTS prep or English speaking practice. The atmosphere in Discord communities is more casual and interactive (voice chats, quick Q&As). Many servers have specific channels where you can share resources. Here are a few to note:

- **IELTS Prep (Discord Server)** – _The largest IELTS-focused Discord_, with **tens of thousands of members** active ([IELTS Prep | Discord Me](https://discord.me/gy4habykpx#:~:text=The%20largest%20and%20most%20active,Discord%20server%20for%20IELTS)). It’s described as a community study group: members practice speaking with each other, do writing peer-reviews, and exchange IELTS tips. There are even volunteer English teachers and native speakers on the server ([IELTS Prep | Discord Me](https://discord.me/gy4habykpx#:~:text=In%20IELTS%20Prep%2C%20you%20can,speakers%20are%20there%20to%20help)). Because it’s so large, there are likely designated channels (e.g. #resources, #writing-feedback) – you should share your landing page in the most relevant channel to avoid appearing spammy. For instance, if your page offers free practice tests, drop the link in a channel about practice materials along with a short message (“Hey everyone, I found this free IELTS practice resource – check it out 【link】, it helped me a lot”). Also consider joining voice chat sessions – once people know you, they’ll be more receptive to your link.
- **General English Practice Servers** – There are Discord servers with massive communities of English learners. One simply called **“English”** has over **700,000 members** ([English - Discord](https://discord.com/invite/english#:~:text=English%20,746103%20members)), making it one of the biggest language learning servers. While not IELTS-specific, such servers often have sub-channels for exam prep or at least thousands of members who happen to be preparing for IELTS/TOEFL. These servers allow resource sharing in moderation. You could post your landing page in a channel like #exam-prep or #useful-links. However, because of the size, expect that any post is quickly buried – so time it when many IELTS learners are active (perhaps after IELTS test dates when interest spikes). The advantage here is sheer reach – even a single post could attract a handful of interested users given the huge member base.
- **IELTS Speaking Practice Hub** – A smaller Discord server (on the order of a few hundred members) specifically aimed at finding speaking partners ([Top Ielts Discord Servers | Discord Server List](https://discadia.com/?q=ielts#:~:text=IELTS%20Speaking%20Practice%20Hub)). In such focused servers, the user base is small but highly engaged. You could introduce your landing page by, say, hosting a **free group speaking session** (“Let’s use questions from this site I’m working on and practice together”). Because Discord is real-time, you can quickly gather feedback by observing how users react to your resource (do they find it useful? any difficulties?). Smaller servers often appreciate any new resource as long as you’re not just dropping a link and leaving. So, stay in the conversation and encourage people to discuss their impressions of the tool.
- **Creating Your Own Discord Group** – As a side note, if you anticipate ongoing need for feedback, you might create a small Discord server for users of your landing page (e.g. invite those who clicked your link to join a “IELTS Prep Feedback” server where you can interact directly). This isn’t about existing communities, but an organic strategy: sometimes after sharing the link, you can funnel the most interested users into a dedicated space for deeper feedback.

## Telegram Channels & Groups

**Telegram** is a popular platform for IELTS prep, especially in regions like South Asia, where many students follow channels run by IELTS coaches or join group chats. Telegram has two modes: **Channels** (one-to-many broadcasting, usually run by a teacher or organization) and **Groups** (many-to-many chats, like a forum in messaging form). Here are relevant Telegram communities:

- **Telegram Channels by IELTS Instructors** – These often have huge followings. For example, _Diyorbek’s IELTS_ channel has **over 92,000 subscribers** ([Diyorbek's IELTS – Telegram](https://t.me/s/diyorbeksielts?before=5051#:~:text=Diyorbek%27s%20IELTS)). Such channels regularly post free tips, practice questions, and sometimes conduct live quizzes or mock tests. Followers read and occasionally comment on posts (Telegram added a comments feature for channel posts). While you **cannot directly post** in someone else’s channel, you can engage by commenting. A tactful approach: become a familiar name by answering other subscribers’ questions in the comments. After establishing a presence, you might mention your landing page if someone asks for resources (“I’ve been using this free site – [your link] – for extra practice, it’s pretty good”). The channel owner might notice too; if they find your resource valuable, they could even give it a shout-out. (It’s worth a try to politely message the admin and offer your free resource for them to share – some are open to it if it’s high quality and free.)
- **IELTS Material Channels** – There are Telegram channels specifically dedicated to sharing IELTS materials. For instance **@ieltsunited** is known for posting study materials covering all IELTS sections ([150 English Grammar Pages: Facebook, YouTube, Reddit, Telegram | Academic Writing University Center](https://awuc.misis.ru/150-english-grammar-pages-facebook-youtube-reddit-telegram/#:~:text=123)), and **@ielts_prime** is run by a professional IELTS trainer who shares educational content frequently ([150 English Grammar Pages: Facebook, YouTube, Reddit, Telegram | Academic Writing University Center](https://awuc.misis.ru/150-english-grammar-pages-facebook-youtube-reddit-telegram/#:~:text=140)). These channels serve up daily exercises, vocabulary lists, etc. Subscribers often number in the thousands. While again you can’t post your own link in the channel feed, you _could_ leverage these by: (a) Drawing inspiration – see what content gets the most engagement and perhaps create a similar useful snippet from your landing page to share elsewhere; (b) Connecting with the channel admin – maybe propose that your landing page be featured as “resource of the day” (emphasize it’s free and beneficial). Some channel admins appreciate having fresh free tools to share.
- **Telegram Study Groups (Chats)** – Aside from channels, Telegram has group chats where members can all talk. For example, _@the_englishclub_ is a group for anyone practicing English ([150 English Grammar Pages: Facebook, YouTube, Reddit, Telegram | Academic Writing University Center](https://awuc.misis.ru/150-english-grammar-pages-facebook-youtube-reddit-telegram/#:~:text=133)), and there are likely IELTS-focused group chats (often formed by members of the above channels or by local study groups). These are harder to find via search, but you might discover them through channel announcements or communities like on Reddit (sometimes users share links to Telegram groups). In a group chat, you can more straightforwardly share your landing page link – but do it _organically_. Perhaps wait until someone asks, “Does anyone have good free practice tests?” and then respond with your link and a short endorsement. Because Telegram groups can have hundreds of messages a day, consider sharing at a time when users are discussing resources. The immediate feedback might be questions (“Does it also cover Speaking?” etc.), which is great for engagement.
- **Language Learning Bots & Communities** – Some Telegram bots (automated accounts) offer IELTS quizzes or vocabulary games. If your landing page has a feature like a quiz, you could create a simple Telegram bot extension as a hook, but that’s a longer-term idea. As for communities, Telegram tends to be segmented by language/region (e.g., there might be an “IELTS Prep [CountryName]” group). Joining region-specific Telegram groups (if you find them) can help tailor your approach – e.g., a group for IELTS in India might respond well if you mention how your free resource helped you get a Band 8 in IELTS Writing, whereas an international group might be more interested in the general usefulness of the tool.

## LinkedIn Groups and Networks

LinkedIn might not be the first platform one thinks of for IELTS prep, but it does host relevant **groups** and is frequented by professionals and students pursuing higher education (who often need IELTS). The tone on LinkedIn is more formal and academic. Sharing on LinkedIn can lend credibility, especially if your landing page is polished and you want feedback from educators or test-takers in a professional context. Key approaches on LinkedIn:

- **LinkedIn IELTS Groups** – LinkedIn has groups like _“IELTS Test”_, _“Free IELTS Preparation with Joe (IELTS examiner)”_, and _“IELTS Training Group”_ ([Linkedin Examination Group | Group Do It](https://linkedin.groupdoit.com/examination/#:~:text=IELTS%20test)). These groups are smaller than Facebook groups but comprised of members serious enough to join an IELTS discussion on a professional network. Typical posts might be people asking for study advice, sharing their IELTS scores and asking what to do better, or teachers sharing articles. You can join these groups (some might require a request approval) and contribute. An example post could be: a short article or LinkedIn post on “5 Free IELTS Resources for 2025” where your landing page is one of the resources (or the main one). Because LinkedIn allows longer-form posts, you can actually repurpose content from your landing page (like a sample question or tip) into a post, then say “for more free practice, I’ve compiled a resource here [link].” This way it’s informational and not just a raw link drop.
- **University & Scholarship Networks** – Many users on LinkedIn mention IELTS in context of admissions. There may not be dedicated IELTS forums, but if you follow university admissions pages or scholarship groups, you’ll find conversations about IELTS requirements. For instance, someone posting “Excited to have scored 7.5 on IELTS, next stop UK!” You can engage by commenting congratulations and subtly mention a resource (“If anyone else is preparing for IELTS, I’ve made a free prep site – happy to share the link if interested!”). This kind of **soft promotion** can pique curiosity without being intrusive.
- **Hashtag and Content Posts** – Use hashtags like **#IELTS**, **#TOEFL**, **#EnglishProficiency** on LinkedIn. People do search these. You could write a LinkedIn Pulse article or a regular post with a story (“I struggled with IELTS Writing until I built my own tool to analyze essays...”) and include your landing page. Such a story-driven approach might get shares or at least comments from others who took IELTS. LinkedIn’s algorithm can sometimes surface a niche post to a much larger audience if it gets initial engagement. And since it’s free to post, it’s worth a try for organic reach.
- **Connecting with IELTS Educators** – There are IELTS coaches and teachers on LinkedIn who post content. If you identify a few (for example, an IELTS tutor who shares weekly tips), you could engage with their posts and eventually share your resource with them directly. They might find it useful for their students. While this is more of a one-to-one networking strategy, it can organically lead to your link being recommended by a reputable teacher, which is high-impact. (Just remember to be polite and not pushy – maybe ask for their feedback on your landing page as a fellow professional.)

By tapping into the communities above, you cover a broad spectrum: large social networks (Facebook, Reddit), real-time chat (Discord, Telegram), and professional/academic circles (forums, LinkedIn). Next, we’ll discuss **how** to share your landing page in these communities effectively, without coming across as a spammer, and how to maximize engagement and feedback.

# Strategies for Organically Sharing Your Landing Page

Identifying the right communities is only half the battle. The key to success is **how** you share your IELTS landing page so that people engage with it and provide feedback, all without paid ads or annoying the community. Below are strategies for organic promotion, focusing on genuine engagement and efficient feedback collection:

## Build Trust and Engage _Before_ You Promote

Jumping into a group and immediately dropping your link is a quick way to get ignored or even banned. Instead, **spend some time as an active participant first**. Contribute to discussions, answer questions, and generally show you’re there to help. For example, if you join a Facebook group, make a few posts or comments over the course of a week that _don’t_ promote anything – maybe share a useful tip about IELTS Reading or congratulate someone on their score. This “karma” building makes people more receptive when you eventually share your landing page ([How to Get Traffic from Facebook Groups (without Being Spammy) | VYPER - Giveaway & Contest Builder](https://vyper.ai/blog/traffic-facebook-groups/#:~:text=Step%202%3A%C2%A0Post%20%26%20Engage)). It also helps you learn the group’s culture. On Reddit, this principle is critical: earn upvotes and karma by being helpful in r/IELTS or related subs _before_ posting your own link. Communities can tell if you’re only there for self-promotion. By proving you’re a genuine member, your link will come off as a friendly recommendation rather than spam.

**Actionable Tip:** Set a goal to comment on 5 posts and make 1 small helpful post in a community _before_ you do any self-promotion. For instance, reply with your advice to someone asking “How do I improve my listening score?” a few times. When people recognize your name/avatar as a helper, they’ll pay attention when you later share something of your own.

## Follow Community Rules (and Norms)

Always check for pinned rules or guidelines in the group or subreddit. Many IELTS groups allow free resource sharing, but some explicitly ban promotional links. If the rules say “no self-promotion,” you might need to take a more nuanced approach (like asking for feedback as a workaround). For example, r/IELTS’s rules note that pure self-advertising is not allowed ([My new IELTS guide is now online! - Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/IELTS/comments/1hj33ia/my_new_ielts_guide_is_now_online/#:~:text=My%20new%20IELTS%20guide%20is,78)), so on Reddit you would frame your post differently (we’ll cover that below). On Facebook, some groups have designated weekly threads for sharing resources or require using certain hashtags. Abiding by these shows respect and increases the chance your post stays up.

Also, observe norms: if nobody in the group ever shares links, then a link post will stand out (and not in a good way). Conversely, if the group is used to people sharing Google Drive files or blog posts, then your landing page link (as a free resource) is within norm. **When in doubt, ask an admin or moderator for permission.** It’s not awkward – something as simple as a message: “Hi, I built a free IELTS practice website. Would it be okay to share it here? I think it could help members with Writing practice. I’m also happy to answer any questions about it in the comments.” Gaining a moderator’s approval can save you from deletion and might even earn their support. In some subreddits, mods will allow a promotional link if you clear it with them and demonstrate its value ([30 Easy Ways To Promote On Reddit | Travelpayouts](https://www.travelpayouts.com/blog/how-to-promote-on-reddit/#:~:text=5)). They might even **post it on your behalf** (which comes across more legit) if they really like it ([30 Easy Ways To Promote On Reddit | Travelpayouts](https://www.travelpayouts.com/blog/how-to-promote-on-reddit/#:~:text=6,Your%20Link)).

**Actionable Tip:** Draft a short “pitch” and send it to the group admin or subreddit moderators. Emphasize _how members benefit_. E.g., “I notice many people ask for writing feedback – I have a free tool on my site that gives instant feedback. Is it okay if I share it? No sign-up or anything required.” This shows you’re considerate and focused on the community’s needs, not just your own.

## Frame Your Post as Helpful (Not Promotional)

When you’re ready to share the landing page, **how you frame it makes all the difference**. You want to avoid sounding like an advertisement. Instead, put on the hat of someone solving a problem for the community:

- **Address a Common Pain Point:** Start your post or title by highlighting an issue IELTS takers face. For example: “Struggling with IELTS Writing Task 2? I built a free tool to get instant feedback on your essays.” This immediately signals that you’re offering a solution, not just “Look at my website!” By describing the problem and solution, you bring value and pique interest ([30 Easy Ways To Promote On Reddit | Travelpayouts](https://www.travelpayouts.com/blog/how-to-promote-on-reddit/#:~:text=To%20advertise%20on%20Reddit%2C%20you,engage%20them%20in%20the%20discussion)).
- **Emphasize that it’s Free and Needs Feedback:** People love free things, and communities love to give opinions. You might say, “I created a free IELTS study resource and would **love feedback** from fellow test-takers.” Now you’re not just promoting, you’re inviting them to be part of improving it. This can flatter users and make them curious to check it out and weigh in. For instance, on Reddit you could literally title the post “Built a free IELTS prep website – would you test it out and give me your feedback?” Such a post doesn’t violate self-promo rules in spirit, because it’s more of a request for help/testing. Similarly on Facebook, you could write a post in a conversational tone: “Hi everyone, I put together a free IELTS practice page with sample questions. I’m not selling anything – just made this as a project. Would anyone be willing to try it and let me know if it’s helpful? 🙂” This kind of genuine ask can get positive responses.
- **Share a Teaser or Result:** If possible, include a quick preview of what your landing page offers directly in the post. For example, share one IELTS question or a tip from your site, then say “there’s more like this on the site.” This way, even if people don’t click, you’ve still contributed content. But those who are interested will click for the rest. On LinkedIn, maybe post an infographic of IELTS band descriptors from your page and then a link. On Discord/Telegram, you could paste one example question from your site with the link to practice more. Giving a taste builds credibility (“oh, this looks legit”).

In all cases, keep the tone **friendly and non-commercial**. Use first person (“I built… I’d love input…”) and avoid any corporate language. The community will respond to _you as a fellow learner_ more than to a “brand.” Being transparent that it’s your project is usually good – authenticity wins trust on platforms like Reddi ([30 Easy Ways To Promote On Reddit | Travelpayouts](https://www.travelpayouts.com/blog/how-to-promote-on-reddit/#:~:text=To%20advertise%20on%20Reddit%2C%20you,engage%20them%20in%20the%20discussion))】. Just don’t oversell (“#1 BEST IELTS SITE EVER!” is a turn-off).

## Choose the Right Time and Medium

For each platform, consider **when and how** to post for maximum impact:

- **Timing:** Post when the community is most active. For Facebook groups with many Asian users, evening in Asia time zones might get more eyes. Reddit r/IELTS might have more activity during weekends when people have time to study. If a big IELTS exam date just passed and scores came out, learners are often more active (either celebrating or looking for ways to improve for a retake). Align your post with these peak times for better engagement. Some tools can analyze the best times (e.g., LaterForReddit for Reddit analytics) but you can also observe patterns yourself.
- **Format:** On **Facebook**, a post with a little formatting goes a long way – e.g., a short intro, maybe an image (if allowed) or an emoji to catch attention, and then your link with a clear call-to-action (“Try it here: [link]”). On **Reddit**, a text post (rather than just a link post) generally attracts more engagement because you can tell the story and users can comment easily. You might do a text post that includes the link within it. On **Discord/Telegram**, keep it succinct since it’s a chat – a brief message and link, possibly pinned by an admin if they allow. On **LinkedIn**, a longer form post or article with the link at the end can work, as discussed. Tailoring your content format to the platform shows you understand how things are usually shared there. For example, many Telegram channels share Google Drive links to materials – you sharing a link to your site providing materials fits that norm well. In contrast, on a forum like IELTSNetwork, you might want to write a forum post (like a blog entry) describing your experience and linking the site, which feels more natural there.

- **Leverage existing threads:** You don’t always have to create a new post. Often, the most _organic_ way is to respond to someone else’s question with your link. For instance, on **Reddit**, if someone asks “Does anyone know a good site for IELTS writing practice?”, that’s a golden opportunity to answer with your landing page and a personal anecdote (“I actually made one because I had the same problem – it’s free and it helped me boost my Writing score from 6.5 to 7. ([New Member - IELTSNetwork.com](https://ieltsnetwork.com/viewtopic.php?t=688#:~:text=Hi%20friends%2C))】, here’s the link”). On **Facebook**, if a member asks “Where can I get free IELTS mock tests?”, you can comment with your site and maybe also mention another well-known free resource (to avoid looking self-serving). Being _the answer_ to someone’s query is the least spammy way to share a link.

## Encourage Interaction and Feedback

Remember, one of your goals is not just to get clicks, but also **collect user feedback** to improve your landing page. To achieve this, try to spark a discussion around your post:

- **Ask Specific Questions:** In your post or after sharing the link, ask users what they think. For example: “Do you find the practice test difficulty realistic?” or “What other features would you like to see for IELTS prep?” Questions invite comments. You can even turn it into a mini-poll (some Facebook groups allow poll posts; on Telegram, you can use the built-in poll feature to ask something like “What’s your hardest IELTS section?”). By engaging users with questions, you not only get feedback but also bump up your post’s visibility (most algorithms push posts with more comments to the top).
- **Offer to Help/Respond:** Make it a two-way street. Say something like “Happy to answer any IELTS questions here as well.” If people start asking questions unrelated to your page, that’s fine – you’re building rapport by helping, and you can subtly guide them to your resource if it’s relevant. For instance, if someone asks “How do I improve my vocabulary?”, you might give a quick tip and mention the vocabulary section on your site. Being super responsive in the comments section also shows you’re active and caring. Users who maybe were on the fence about clicking your link might do so after seeing how engaged you are (they think, “This person really knows their stuff and is enthusiastic, their site might be useful”).
- **Acknowledge feedback publicly:** If someone says “I tried your site, the interface is cool!”, reply and thank them. If they say “It’s good but I wish it had more reading tests,” reply that you appreciate the idea and are working on it. This kind of interaction not only gives you direct insights but also builds a positive image. Other readers see these comments and might be convinced to try the site themselves (“free resource with a responsive creator, why not”). Plus, you might get _additional ideas_ from these conversations – essentially free user research.

- **Utilize Testimonials or Results:** If a user shares a success story thanks to your resource (even a small one, like “That site helped me understand True/False/Not Given questions better”), with their permission, highlight that in future posts. In organic promotion, social proof works wonders. For example, later on you could post: “Last month I shared my free IELTS site here – thanks to those who tried it! One user improved her Reading score from 6 to 7 after practicing with i ([New Member - IELTSNetwork.com](https://ieltsnetwork.com/viewtopic.php?t=688#:~:text=I%20am%20Sweta%20%26%20i,from%20you%20guys%20is%20welcomed))】. This encouraged me to add more reading exercises. If you haven’t seen it yet, here’s the link…” This follow-up not only re-shares the link but also shows that real people benefited, making others more likely to check it out.

## Leverage Influencers and Admin Support

We touched on contacting moderators, but more broadly, identify if there are any **influential figures** in these communities and see if you can collaborate. For example, the owner of a large Facebook group or a popular IELTS YouTuber who has a Discord server might be an “influencer” in this niche. Since you’re focusing on organic methods, you’re not paying them, but you can approach with a value proposition. Perhaps offer something like: “I can write a guest post for your group about IELTS Writing tips and include my tool as one of the tips” – they get quality content for free, you get exposure. Or, “I noticed many students in your group ask about speaking feedback – I have a free tool that might help, would you be open to me hosting a live Q&A in the group about IELTS Speaking?” If an admin invites you to share, it’s automatically seen as vetted. As the travel marketing example suggests, \*_admins sharing your link is 10x more powerful_ ([30 Easy Ways To Promote On Reddit | Travelpayouts](https://www.travelpayouts.com/blog/how-to-promote-on-reddit/#:~:text=6,Your%20Link))】. While not every admin will respond, it’s worth a try for the biggest communities. Even a retweet or share from an IELTS blogger (like IELTS Liz or others) could bring in targeted users – consider reaching out to them with a polite message about your free tool.

On LinkedIn, this might translate to getting a comment or reshare from an English teaching professional, which can massively broaden your post’s reach.

## Maintain a Helpful, Non-Spammy Persona

Across all interactions, maintain the persona of a **helpful peer** rather than a marketer. A good mindset: “I’m an IELTS student (or recent test-taker) who has created something useful and I want to share it with my fellow learners.” This genuineness should come across in your tone. Avoid posting the same message verbatim across many groups – if people are in multiple IELTS groups (which is common), they’ll see the copy-paste and it will hurt your credibility. Instead, tailor each post to the group or platform. It can be as simple as changing a few words to fit the audience (“Hey, IELTS Redditors!” vs “Hi IELTS fighters on Facebook, hope your prep is going well…”). Small personal touches make your posts feel less like an ad blast.

Also, pace your sharing. Don’t drop your link in 10 places all on the same day. Not only could that trigger spam filters (especially on Facebook), but you also won’t be able to **manage the responses** effectively. It’s better to stagger your posts – maybe start with one Reddit post and one Facebook group post today. Engage with the comments for a couple of days, then share in another group, and so on. This way, you’re always available to engage when the post is fresh. It’s “slow” marketing, but it yields deeper engagement.

**Actionable Tip:** Keep a simple log of where and when you shared the landing page, and note the feedback. For example:

- _Jan 10_: Posted in “IELTS Free Preparation 9.0” (FB) – 10 likes, 5 comments (2 people said they’ll try it, 1 bug reported about mobile view).
- _Jan 12_: Commented with link on r/IELTS thread about Reading practice – got 3 upvotes, one person thanked me.

This helps you track which communities are most responsive and what feedback was gathered. It will also prevent you from accidentally spamming the same group twice in a short span.

## Offer Ongoing Value

To maximize impact, think beyond one-off posts. How can you integrate your landing page into the community long-term? Perhaps you start a **weekly thread** on a forum: “IELTS Writing Feedback Friday – post your essay, I’ll give feedback (using insights from my tool).” In the process, you mention your site (“I ran this essay through my tool for some stats, and here’s my personal feedback…”). This positions your resource as a staple in their prep routine. Or host a free webinar/Discord voice chat session on “IELTS Tips” and use that opportunity to guide people to your site (e.g., “we’ll practice 1–2 questions from my site live”). Essentially, by continuing to be active and providing value, you keep drawing users back to your page and get new ones via word of mouth.

Lastly, **stay receptive**. Some feedback might be critical (“I didn’t find your questions useful” or “the site load time is slow”). Respond professionally and take notes. Showing that you’re improving the resource based on user input will win respect. You can even circle back to the community later with an update: “You suggested we add a Band 9 sample essay – it’s now live on the site, thanks for the great idea!” This closes the loop and encourages further engagement.

By carefully choosing communities and using the strategies above, you can **organically introduce your landing page to real IELTS test-takers** and spark meaningful engagement. The key themes are: _be genuine, be helpful, and be patient_. Rather than traditional ads, you’re leveraging trust and interaction – which in the education space can be far more powerful. With consistent effort, you’ll not only drive traffic to your landing page but also build a supportive network of users who feel almost invested in your project’s success (since they gave feedback to shape it). Good luck, and happy sharing!
