Really dig into the difference and mention what actually changed.
When updating a text somewhere, Dont only mention "Clarify and update instruction content to reflect current requirements." but also say for example: Change the word "personalized" to "personalised"
Really try to understand the change, and communicate the details of that change.
Do not mention the same change twice basically.
Keep the description short if possible, especially for a small change. We do not need to make a long description for a one line change, only if we really need to explain it.
